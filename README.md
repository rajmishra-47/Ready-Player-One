## 🏗️ Architecture

The app follows **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture:

- **Model**: Data structures and logic
- **View**: SwiftUI components for UI
- **ViewModel**: Binds data to UI using `@StateObject`, `@Published`, etc.

Uses `async/await` for smooth and responsive asynchronous tasks.
